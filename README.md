Face Recognition Attendance System
Overview
The Face Recognition Attendance System is an automated solution designed to streamline attendance tracking in workplaces, schools, and other institutions. It uses facial recognition technology to identify and record the attendance of individuals in real-time, reducing the need for manual processes like signing sheets or ID cards.

Features
Face Recognition: Uses computer vision and machine learning to detect and recognize faces.
Real-time Attendance: Automatically logs attendance in real time when an individual's face is detected and recognized.
User Management: Admins can add or remove individuals and update their facial data.
Attendance Report Generation: Provides daily, weekly, or monthly reports on attendance records.
Database Integration: Attendance data is stored in a database for future reference.
Multi-Camera Support: The system can support multiple cameras for larger spaces.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
OpenCV: For face detection and image processing.
Dlib: For face recognition and alignment.
Face_recognition: A Python library built on dlib to simplify face recognition.
Numpy: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
SQLite/MySQL: For storing attendance data and user records.
Framework: Flask (optional for web-based interface)
Hardware: Any camera (e.g., USB webcam or laptop camera) for face detection.
Requirements
Hardware Requirements:
A computer or Raspberry Pi with a camera.
Decent processing power (especially if using real-time face recognition for many individuals).
Software Requirements:
Python 3.x
Libraries: OpenCV, Dlib, face_recognition, Numpy, Flask (if using the web interface)
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-attendance-system.git
cd face-recognition-attendance-system
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python dlib face_recognition numpy
If you are using Flask for a web interface, install Flask as well:

bash
Copy code
pip install Flask
3. Install Dlib (Optional but recommended for accurate face recognition)
If Dlib is not automatically installed, follow the official Dlib installation guide.

4. Setup the Database
You can use SQLite or MySQL to store the attendance data. For SQLite (default option):

bash
Copy code
sqlite3 attendance.db
For MySQL, install MySQL and configure your database connection in the code:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE attendance_system;
5. Add Users
To add new users to the system, you can either:

Upload images of the user to the dataset/ folder with a subfolder named after the user.
Use a script to register users by capturing images through the camera.
For example, the folder structure for users might look like:

markdown
Copy code
dataset/
    ├── John/
        ├── john1.jpg
        ├── john2.jpg
    ├── Jane/
        ├── jane1.jpg
        ├── jane2.jpg
Run the encoding script to convert these images into data for recognition:

bash
Copy code
python encode_faces.py
6. Running the Application
Start the application by running the main Python script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
If you are using the Flask web interface, start the Flask server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your browser to access the web-based interface (if applicable).

How It Works
Face Detection: The camera captures images in real time. OpenCV is used to detect faces from the video feed.
Face Recognition: Detected faces are compared against pre-registered faces using the face_recognition library. If a match is found, the person's attendance is recorded.
Attendance Logging: The system logs attendance in the database, associating the current date and time with the recognized individual.
Report Generation: Admins can generate attendance reports through the web interface or by exporting data directly from the database.
Usage
Register New Users: Add the images of the person to the dataset/ folder and run the encoding script.
Start Attendance Capture: Run the system to start capturing attendance automatically as users are recognized.
View Attendance: View or export attendance logs from the database.
Admin Panel: Use the Flask web interface to manage users and view reports.

Future Enhancements
SMS/Email Notification: Send attendance notifications to users or admins.
Mobile App: Develop a mobile app for easier access to the system.
Multi-Camera Support: Enhance the system to support multiple cameras for wider coverage.
Face Mask Detection: Add a feature to detect if a person is wearing a mask.
